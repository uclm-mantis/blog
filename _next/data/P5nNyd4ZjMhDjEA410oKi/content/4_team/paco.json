He has participated in over 40 research projects, serving as Principal Investigator (PI) in 10 of them. He is the author of 21 articles in specialized journals and 67 conference papers. He also holds two patents and has supervised three doctoral theses.\n\nDuring his doctoral thesis, he developed the concept of a pico-object, enabling a distributed infrastructure akin to the object-oriented architectures of the 1990s, offering partial fault transparency and complete location transparency. Unlike conventional distributed object architectures, pico-objects can be implemented in hardware on System-on-Chip platforms, wide-area multi-protocol networks, or IoT environments. This work continues in projects such as HADA, CORE, ARES, SODA, RGRID, DAMA, DREAMS, and SAND, focusing on middleware with advanced features for heterogeneous systems, including reconfigurable hardware components and services like persistence, implicit activation, replication, migration, and more.\n","slug":"4_team/paco","fileTree":[],"contentHtml":{"compiledSource":"\"use strict\";\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = {\n    p: \"p\",\n    ..._provideComponents(),\n    ...props.components\n  };\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Telecommunications Engineer with a PhD from UPM in 2003 and Associate Professor in the Computer Architecture and Technology area at UCLM since 2019.
