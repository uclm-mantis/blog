<p>His research activity spans four main areas: 1) methodologies for the design of complex heterogeneous systems, 2) the application of distributed system concepts to the design of embedded electronic systems, sensor networks, and large-scale distributed services; 3) security in electronic systems; and 4) the application of computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques to a wide range of topics (e.g., ambient intelligence, defect analysis, and bioaerosol classification).

He also holds two patents and has supervised three doctoral theses.</p>
<p>During his doctoral thesis, he developed the concept of a pico-object, enabling a distributed infrastructure akin to the object-oriented architectures of the 1990s, offering partial fault transparency and complete location transparency. Unlike conventional distributed object architectures, pico-objects can be implemented in hardware on System-on-Chip platforms, wide-area multi-protocol networks, or IoT environments. This work continues in projects such as HADA, CORE, ARES, SODA, RGRID, DAMA, DREAMS, and SAND, focusing on middleware with advanced features for heterogeneous systems, including reconfigurable hardware components and services like persistence, implicit activation, replication, migration, and more.</p></div></article></div></main><div class="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0"><aside class="pointer-events-auto absolute top-0 bottom-0 right-0 bg-gray-100 shadow-lg border-l border-gray-300 overflow-hidden z-30" style="width:0px"><div class="p-4 h-full"><ul class="text-black"><li><a class="block py-1 hover:text-blue-500" href="/blog/content/4_team/paco">Francisco Moya Fernández</a></li><li><a class="block py-1 hover:text-blue-500" href="/blog/content/4_team/user1">Tim Burton</a></li><li><a class="block py-1 hover:text-blue-500" href="/blog/content/4_team/user2">Linus Torvalds</a></li></ul></div></aside><button class=" pointer-events-auto absolute text-white rounded-l-md shadow-md bg-gray-500 z-40 flex items-center justify-center " tabindex="0" style="width:20px;height:80px;top:calc(50vh - 40px);right:0px"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentColor" class="w-5 h-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15 19l-7-7 7-7"></path></svg></button></div></div><footer class="bg-gray-800 text-white py-4 text-center"><p>MBlog<!-- --> © 2024 Mantis Research Group</p></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":{"id":"5022422-A","title":"Francisco Moya Fernández","givenName":"Francisco","sn":"Moya Fernández","email":"francisco.moya@uclm.es","github":"FranciscoMoya","orcid":"0000-0002-6842-4999","image":"/blog/team/paco.jpg","phone":"+34 926295483","position":"Associate Professor","section":"Team","type":"member","content":"\nTelecommunications Engineer with a PhD from UPM in 2003 and Associate Professor in the Computer Architecture and Technology area at UCLM since 2019.
